# Next Week's Money — SOP

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-next-week-money-plan-design.md` (rulings P-1..P-14)
**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-23-next-week-money.md` (Tasks 0..8)
**Status:** Task 0 shipped (v27.130). This SOP grows one section per task; Task 8 completes it.

> One engine plans next week's not-good money for the working families (HARVEST book: Bottle,
> Lollibox, LolliME, Fresh). Good keywords are never cut and never re-priced (P-4). The not-good
> ones compete for numbered, dollar-sized seats inside an allowance that is a declared share of
> what the good side actually spent in the window; the rest queue at zero.

## 1. The config layer (Task 0, v27.130)

Two objects, and nothing else in the plan may write a window, a share, a ramp or an order floor
as a literal.

| object | file | what it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `DE_PLAN_CONFIG` | `scripts/bigquery/tables/DE/DE_PLAN_CONFIG.sql` | given a calendar state, how long is the window, what share of the good side does the not-good side get, over how many windows does the allowance ramp, how many orders make a keyword good, and which plan is live |
| `FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE(d DATE)` | `scripts/bigquery/functions/FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE.sql` | which calendar state a date is in |
| acceptance | `scripts/bigquery/tests/PLAN_CONFIG_acceptance.sql` | every row must read `PASS` |

### How a reader uses them

Always join, never hardcode. The pattern every plan object follows:

```sql
SELECT c.window_days, c.allowance_share, c.live_plan, c.ramp_steps, c.min_orders
FROM `onyga-482313.OI.DE_PLAN_CONFIG` c
WHERE c.is_active
  AND c.calendar_state = `onyga-482313.OI.FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE`(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York'))
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.calendar_state ORDER BY c.updated_at DESC) = 1
```

The calendar is read on **New York** (it is a US retail calendar); the ads facts the window then
selects are read on **Los Angeles**, and the window is complete days only — `window_days` days
ending at the ads watermark minus one, where the watermark is
`LEAST(MAX(date), FN_ADS_ANCHOR_CAP())` over `FACT_AMAZON_ADS` (P-10). The filling day never
enters a window.

### The settings, and who may change them

`window_days`, `allowance_share`, `ramp_steps`, `min_orders` and `live_plan` are **declared
settings**, not measurements. The seeded values are P-13 and P-3: 7 complete days off-peak and 3
in BOOST and PEAK; a 0.20 share off-peak and in PEAK and 0.50 in BOOST; three ramp steps (P-8's
one third of the gap per window — `ramp_steps` and "ramp thirds" are the same setting); two
orders in the window; plan `B` live with plan `A` written nightly in shadow (P-9).

**Ori changes a setting without a deploy.** Insert a new active row for the state with a later
`updated_at`, then retire the old one:

```sql
INSERT INTO `onyga-482313.OI.DE_PLAN_CONFIG`
  (calendar_state, window_days, allowance_share, live_plan, ramp_steps, min_orders,
   is_active, description, updated_at, updated_by)
VALUES ('BOOST', 3, 0.35, 'B', 3, 2, TRUE, 'why this changed, in words', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 'ori');

UPDATE `onyga-482313.OI.DE_PLAN_CONFIG`
SET is_active = FALSE
WHERE calendar_state = 'BOOST' AND updated_by = 'plan_seed';
```

Never edit the DDL file to change a live setting. Re-running the DDL rewrites **only** the rows
whose `updated_by = 'plan_seed'`; a row Ori entered by hand survives it. Whether 0.50 is the
right BOOST share is an open learning question — `V_PLAN_SCORECARD` and the backtest answer it
per state on evidence, and until they do the seed stands.

### The calendar states, and why PEAK wins

`FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE` reads the **live** `DIM_US_HOLIDAYS` (categories `gift_season`,
`prime_event`, `back_to_school`, `seasonal`, rows carrying a `boost_start`) — never a date
literal, and never the repo seed, which is stale.

- **PEAK** — `peak_start` through `COALESCE(cooldown_end, holiday_date + 3)`.
- **BOOST** — `boost_start` through the day before `COALESCE(peak_start, holiday_date)`.
- **OFF_PEAK** — anything else. The function never returns `NULL`.

The seasons on the live calendar **overlap**: a single date routinely sits inside one season's
peak and another season's run-up at the same time. The plan needs one window and one share per
date, so precedence is declared: **a peak anywhere beats a run-up everywhere**, because the
tighter window is the safer read while real money is moving. The acceptance asserts the
precedence on a live overlap date rather than trusting this paragraph.

A consequence worth knowing before Q4: the autumn is mostly PEAK, not BOOST, because Halloween's
peak opens well before Christmas's does, and the Christmas run-up is short. **Read the shape of
the year from the function, never from this document** — editing the calendar moves it:

```sql
WITH d AS (SELECT day, `onyga-482313.OI.FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE`(day) AS s
           FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY(DATE '2026-08-20', DATE '2026-12-31')) day),
g AS (SELECT day, s, IF(s = LAG(s) OVER (ORDER BY day), 0, 1) AS brk FROM d),
r AS (SELECT day, s, SUM(brk) OVER (ORDER BY day) AS grp FROM g)
SELECT s AS state, MIN(day) AS from_day, MAX(day) AS to_day, COUNT(*) AS days
FROM r GROUP BY s, grp ORDER BY from_day;
```

If Ori wants the pre-Black-Friday weeks judged as a run-up at the BOOST share rather than as a
peak at the PEAK share, that is a **calendar edit or a precedence ruling**, not a code change:
either move Halloween's `peak_start` on `DIM_US_HOLIDAYS`, or overrule the precedence line above.

### Deploy and verify

```bash
cd /Users/ori/Develop/OI
bq query --project_id=onyga-482313 --use_legacy_sql=false --nouse_cache "$(grep -v '^--' scripts/bigquery/tables/DE/DE_PLAN_CONFIG.sql)"
bq query --project_id=onyga-482313 --use_legacy_sql=false --nouse_cache "$(grep -v '^--' scripts/bigquery/functions/FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE.sql)"
bq query --project_id=onyga-482313 --use_legacy_sql=false --nouse_cache "$(grep -v '^--' scripts/bigquery/tests/PLAN_CONFIG_acceptance.sql)"
```

The DDL is idempotent: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, then `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT
EXISTS` so a re-run converges against a table that already exists (a bare
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a silent no-op there), then a `plan_seed`-scoped delete and
re-insert. The acceptance must read `PASS` on every row; `C03` asserts the live calendar, so it
is also the alarm that fires when someone edits `DIM_US_HOLIDAYS`.

### What today's settings are

Do not write them down here — read them:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York') AS today_ny,
       `onyga-482313.OI.FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE`(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York')) AS state,
       c.window_days, c.allowance_share, c.live_plan, c.ramp_steps, c.min_orders, c.description
FROM `onyga-482313.OI.DE_PLAN_CONFIG` c
WHERE c.is_active
  AND c.calendar_state = `onyga-482313.OI.FN_PLAN_CALENDAR_STATE`(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York'));
```
