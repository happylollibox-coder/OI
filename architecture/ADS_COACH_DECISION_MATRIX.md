## Target-Level Actions (`target_action` column)

| Priority | Action | Conditions | Guard |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| 1 | `CAMPAIGN_PAUSED` | Campaign state != ENABLED | — |
| 2 | `STOP_TARGET` | 0 orders + min clicks + active 5d | — |

## Budget Actions (`budget_action` column)

| Action | Conditions |
|--------|------------|
| `INCREASE_BUDGET` | Campaign profitable + high utilization |
| `DECREASE_BUDGET` | Campaign unprofitable + low utilization |
| `RESTORE_BUDGET` | Cooldown: restore to pre-peak budget |
| `KEEP_BUDGET` | Default |

---

## Cross-Sell Action (`ADD_CROSS_SELL_TARGET`)

Self-brand cross-sell: advertise product **B** on product **A**'s detail page,
chosen from proven in-brand co-purchase affinity. This is a *separate* engine
from the term/target/budget decisions above — it has its own view and grain.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Source | `V_ADS_COACH_CROSSSELL` (grain `target_asin` × `advertise_asin`) → materialized to `T_ADS_COACH_CROSSSELL` → `AdsCoachCrossSell` cube |
| Signal | `V_SRC_AmazonAds_purchased_product` — shoppers who engaged ads for A (`advertised_asin`) then bought B (`purchased_asin`), last 30d, our ASINs only, A ≠ B |
| Gate | `cross_orders_30d ≥ CROSS_SELL_MIN_ORDERS` (default **3**) **and** the pair is not already covered by a live product-target (gaps only, via `FACT_AMAZON_ADS.targeting` `asin=` coverage) |
| Confidence | HIGH ≥ 10 orders · MEDIUM ≥ 5 · LOW ≥ 3 (30d) |
| Surface | Actions page "🔁 Cross-sell" section, grouped by `target_parent`; `+ Queue` enqueues an `ADD_CROSS_SELL_TARGET` item (`product` = B, `targeting` = `asin="A"`, `match_type` = PRODUCT_TARGETING, **no fabricated bids**) |
| Export | Do-page bulksheet emits a Sponsored Products **product-targeting** campaign (Campaign → Ad Group → Product Targeting `asin="A"` → Product Ad for B). Budget, bid floor and product-page placement all come from the **`PRODUCT_DEFENSE`** row of `DIM_STRATEGY_CAMPAIGN_TEMPLATE` (no hardcoding); deduped against live campaigns. |

## Safety Guards

### ⚡ Lag Window Safety Check (NEW — 2026-04-13)

**Problem**: The 4-day data lag excludes the most recent 3 days from the weighted ROAS calculation. During this window, sales may already be occurring but are invisible to the decision engine, causing premature REDUCE_BID or NEGATE_EXACT actions.

**Solution**: Before executing any ROAS-based reduction/negation, peek at the lag window:

| Level | Metric | Source CTE | Column |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Term** | Net ROAS of last 3 days for this search_term | `ads_lag` | `ads_lag_net_roas` |
| **Target** | Net ROAS of last 3 days for this targeting keyword | `target_rollup_lag` | `target_lag_net_roas` |

**Rule**: If lag ROAS > **1.3**, the action is deferred to **MONITOR** (term) or **MONITOR_TARGET** (target). The rationale: those lag-window sales will naturally mature into the 8-week weighted ROAS within days, and a reduction now would be premature.

**Scope**: Only applies to ROAS-based actions. Zero-order negations (0 orders in 8 weeks) are NOT guarded — no amount of recent data justifies 8 weeks of zero conversions.

### ⏸️ Paused Target Guard (NEW — 2026-04-13)

**Problem**: Paused or archived targets (keyword-level) were still receiving INCREASE_BID / REDUCE_BID recommendations, which is misleading and not actionable.

**Solution**: Before evaluating bid thresholds, check `target_keyword_status` (derived from the latest `ad_keyword_status` in `FACT_AMAZON_ADS`). If the status is not `ENABLED`, emit `TARGET_PAUSED` and skip all bid logic.

| Field | Source | Value |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `target_keyword_status` | `V_ADS_COACH_DATA` → `FACT_AMAZON_ADS.ad_keyword_status` | `ENABLED` / `PAUSED` / `ARCHIVED` |

**Scope**: Applies only to target-level bid actions (`INCREASE_BID`, `REDUCE_BID`). Campaign-level `CAMPAIGN_PAUSED` (based on `campaign_state`) is checked separately and takes priority.

## Decision Trace (JSON chips)

Each row includes a `term_decision_trace` and `target_decision_trace` column containing a JSON array of decision chips:

### Term trace chips
| Chip ID | Label | Rule |
|---------|-------|------|
| `clicks` | Clicks 8w | ≥ min_clicks threshold |
| `orders` | Orders 8w | > 0 |
| `roas` | OS WtROAS | ≥ negate threshold |
| `term_lag` | Lag ROAS (3d) | ≤ 1.3 → negate *(only when ROAS < negate threshold + orders > 0)* |

### Target trace chips
| Chip ID | Label | Rule |
|---------|-------|------|
| `tgt_clicks` | Target Clicks 8w | ≥ min_clicks threshold |
| `tgt_orders` | Target Orders 8w | ≥ 2 |
| `tgt_roas` | Target WtROAS | ≥ profitable threshold |
| `tgt_spend` | Target Spend 8w | context |
| `tgt_lag` | Lag ROAS (3d) | ≤ 1.3 → reduce *(only when ROAS < reduce threshold + orders > 0)* |
| `tgt_status` | Target Status | ENABLED *(only when target is paused/archived)* |

---

## Thresholds (from `DE_COACH_THRESHOLDS`)

| Threshold | Key | Default | Used By |
|-----------|-----|---------|---------|
| Min Clicks | `min_clicks` | 15 | Insufficient data gate |
| Negate ROAS | `negate_roas` | 0.5 | NEGATE_EXACT / STOP_TERM |
| Negate Spend | `negate_spend` | $20 | Legacy (clicks preferred) |
| Reduce Bid ROAS | `reduce_bid_roas` | 0.9 | REDUCE_BID |
| Scale Up ROAS | `scale_up_roas` | 2.0 | INCREASE_BID (STRONG tier) |
| Profitable ROAS | `profitable_roas` | 1.1 | INCREASE_BID (the **bid-up floor** = `min(profitable, scale_up)`) |
| Promote Min Orders | `promote_min_orders` | 4 | PROMOTE_TO_EXACT |
| Promote Min ROAS | `promote_min_roas` | 1.5 | PROMOTE_TO_EXACT |
| Cross-Sell Min Orders | `CROSS_SELL_MIN_ORDERS` | 3 | ADD_CROSS_SELL_TARGET (`V_ADS_COACH_CROSSSELL`) |
| Halo ROAS | `halo_roas` | 0.5 | SQP halo credit |
| Bid Ceiling | `bid_cap_suggestion` | **$2.00** | Hard cap on every recommended bid |
| Defense Dominate IS% | `defense_dominate_is_pct` | **50** | BRAND_DEFENSE bid-up gate |

> **Reminder:** the bar called `profitable_roas` is **not "profitable"** for every strategy — it is the per-strategy **bid-up floor**, and several strategies set it below ad-breakeven on purpose (NEW_LAUNCH 0.5, SEASONAL_PUSH 0.7). The decision trace must explain the *intent* per strategy in plain language, never just "profitable threshold."

### Per-strategy `profitable_roas` (GUARDIAN), post-2026-06-16

| Strategy | Bar | Rationale |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| GLOBAL, HUNTER, EXACT_BOOST, LOW_COST_DISCOVERY, CATEGORY_CONQUEST, TOS_DOMINATION, RETARGETING | **1.1** | must be ad-profitable to scale (net ROAS is ads-only, breakeven = 1.0) |
| SEASONAL_PUSH | 0.7 | keep peak-proven terms warm for the next peak |
| NEW_LAUNCH | 0.5 | first days push for clicks to learn — buy rank at a controlled loss |
| BRAND_DEFENSE / PRODUCT_DEFENSE | 3.0 / 2.0 | vestigial for the ROAS bar — defense never scales on ROAS (see redesign §) |

---

## Mode-Aware ROAS Resolution

The ROAS metric used depends on the coach mode:

| Mode | Term ROAS | Target ROAS |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **GUARDIAN** | `COALESCE(ads_weighted_net_roas_offseason, ads_weighted_net_roas, ads_net_roas_8w)` | `COALESCE(target_weighted_net_roas_offseason, target_weighted_net_roas, target_net_roas_8w)` |
| **COOLDOWN** | Same as GUARDIAN | Same as GUARDIAN |
| **BLITZ** | `COALESCE(ads_weighted_net_roas_hotseason, ads_weighted_net_roas, ads_net_roas_8w)` | `COALESCE(target_weighted_net_roas_hotseason, target_weighted_net_roas, target_net_roas_8w)` |
| **Default** | `COALESCE(ads_weighted_net_roas, ads_net_roas_8w)` | `COALESCE(target_weighted_net_roas, target_net_roas_8w)` |

## 2026-06-16 GUARDIAN Redesign

Net ROAS used for all bid decisions is **ads-only** (`margin_per_unit × ad-attributed units ÷ ad spend`); breakeven = 1.0; no organic/SQP halo. Changes:

1. **Bid-up floor = 1.1** across non-discovery strategies (see per-strategy table). The floor is `min(profitable_roas, scale_up_roas)`, so HUNTER also got `scale_up_roas` 1.0→2.0. Stops bidding *up* terms that aren't ad-profitable.
2. **`NEEDS_STRATEGY`** (new target_action): a target on a campaign with no mapped strategy gets no bid action — it is flagged for the user to assign a strategy (name-based suggestion reused from the Campaign Mapping panel). No more silent GLOBAL-bar fallback on unmapped campaigns.
3. **Frequency-gate bypass**: the GUARDIAN 7-day bid-change cadence may be bypassed at **≥3 days** if the **3-day net ROAS ≥ 2.0** (`ads_net_roas_3d`) — strong winners aren't held a full week.
4. **`DEFENDED`** (new `ads_signal`): BRAND/PRODUCT_DEFENSE terms report `DEFENDED` instead of the misleading `WASTED_SPEND`.
5. **Defense bid-raise** (replaces pure `MONITOR_TARGET` for defense — purpose: control the auction and make terms expensive for competitors):
   - **BRAND_DEFENSE** (brand search terms): `INCREASE_BID` toward the $2 ceiling when SQP `impression_share_pct < defense_dominate_is_pct` (50%); else MONITOR (already dominating). Share comes from `FACT_SEARCH_QUERY`.
   - **PRODUCT_DEFENSE** (ASIN targeting on own detail pages): `INCREASE_BID` toward the $2 ceiling **unconditionally** when `current_bid < ceiling` — no SQP signal exists for detail-page slots; intent is to occupy own listings.
6. **Bid ceiling**: every recommended bid is capped at `bid_cap_suggestion` ($2.00, GLOBAL default). When the cap binds, the trace carries a "bid set by BID Ceiling" chip.
7. **Dead config dropped**: `PROMOTE_ROAS_THRESHOLD` (never read — pivot uses `PROMOTE_MIN_ROAS`) and `REDUCE_BID_SPEND` (no logic) removed from `DE_COACH_THRESHOLDS`.
8. **Per-strategy reasoning**: decision-trace explains each strategy's intent in plain language (the `profitable` bar is not self-explanatory).

**Follow-ups (not in this change):** display research_rank + source keyword on cards; PRODUCT_DEFENSE self-brand cross-sell (suggest adding own ASINs as product-targets on own listings).
